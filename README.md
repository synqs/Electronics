# Electronics in the matterwave 

Here we have several electronics projects. 

## balancedphotodiode

This was a bachelor project by Lilo HÃ¶cker. It was used for a balanced PD design
in a polarization spectroscopy and worked fine. 

## simplePDboard

Just a simple board to have a transimpedence attached to the normal OSRAM PD.

## MagneticFieldSensor

We should add this here as it was the main project to the 18bit DAC and the 
digi-poti adapter.

## others

the other projects were created before mostly by Marcell Gall.
