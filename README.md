# Electronics in SynQS 

Here we have several electronics projects. Feel free to use and improve them.

## balancedphotodiode

It was used for a balanced PD design
in a polarization spectroscopy and worked fine. Designed initially by Lilo HÃ¶cker.

## simplePDboard

Just a simple board to have a transimpedence attached to the normal OSRAM PD.

## MagneticFieldSensor

We should add this here as it was the main project to the 18bit DAC and the 
digi-poti adapter. Designed initially by Marcell Gall.

## AOM_powersupply

A board which allows to drive a combination of VCO, attenuator, switch and amplifier. Designed initially by Pradyumna Paranjabe.

## shutter_board

A simple board to control a relay shutter. Designed initially by Pradyumna Paranjabe.

## others

the other projects were created before.
